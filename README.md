Program Filename: whiskey_to_wine.py  
(Programmer's Note:  This is naive code, created for educational demonstration of concept purposes only.)

#### Simple program that calculates the amount of any non-alcoholic beverage that must be added to any alcoholic beverage of known proof and volume to result in the same ABV% as wine.

#### Purpose: Demonstration of a pseudo-real-world application of the V1C1=V2C2 dillution formula.

Usage:  Execute file and follow prompts.  If no input or improper input is given, defaults of 80 proof and 1.5 oz will be used.
  -OR-  Import the module whiskey_to_wine and execute the function whiskey2wine(proof, ounces).

A super simple unittest file is included to validate results given any and all realistic argument values.

Requires Python 3.8 or newer (in theory).
